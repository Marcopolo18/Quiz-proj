I will keep it brief by saying that the myriad of variables and what was going on was way too far above me, but so is the sky, and the sky is nice, so, yeah.

Mainly lots of errors of non defined variables or empty arrays. I may clear up the last of them yet.

Setting up the databank tables and linking them took up much of my time as well.
