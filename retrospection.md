A John Paul Jones moment all in all.

It was rather more frustrating than challenging, but hell, that is what fighting is.

As much as I appreciate all the help and support I get from Chris and my mates, I feel it stifles my growth, however the alternative would be even more hollow days staring at an error on a screen, so I both greatly appreciate the help and deal with an appreciation of my lack of knowledge simultaneously.
